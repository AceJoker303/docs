## Application & Review

A recruit will submit an application [here](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/leo/apply#application-process), Upon submission of the application a ticket will be opened in the Discord server with the application. We will review the applicant application in the private thread attached.

Once reviewed and accepted, We will move forward with the FTO process.

## Discord Roles

Upon acceptance before training we will grant the department specific role along with the department recruit role to the member.
This will grant the recruit all the permissions in the CAD and in-game.

Then post in the [#roster-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1132847710282727565/1270093499110395944) the updated positions!


## CAD Registration

The recruit will likely need to fully logout of the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com) and re-login via Discord to gain access to the new permissions.

If the recruit doesn't already have a citizen in the CAD they will need to [create one.](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/cad/citizens)

Next, Head over to the "Officer" tab and then "[My Officers](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/officer/my-officers)". Select "Create Officer" select the citizen, and give the call sign based off the [roster](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/leo/information/directory).

- A recruit is allowed *3 minor mistakes per phase* and only *3 major mistakes* throughout the entire process, or *1 critical mistake*.
- Failing this process requires the recruit to review the documentation and restart the training.
- Multiple failures necessitate resubmission of the initial application.

Based on this evaluation three things can happen.
