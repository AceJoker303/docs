# First Shift

Congrats on passing the application and training phase for becoming a LEO!

Now, we'll learn the basics of being a LEO and how to get started on your first shift!


For these examples your callsign is 2N(Nora)-40.
Dispatch is 6-5-1

## Traffic Stop

The main things to say when on a traffic stop are 1. Who you are, 2. Location, 3. Vehicle description.
You'll always say the unit you are calling first, then your callsign.

If you ever need additionals to the traffic stop, SImply say, Requesting additionals.

### W/O dispatch
(Without dispatch online)

> 2N-40 I'll be out on traffic at [postal] [street/location] with a [color] [make/model/type] [plate type] [plate] occupied times [count] 

To explain this further, You are calling out on the radio you have initiated a traffic stop at a location, Next you are giving out the description of the vehicle incase it's needed to locate at a later time and for dispatch to reference when searching for the vehicle, and lastly you are giving out the occupancy of the vehicle, So how many people are in the vehicle, If unknown don't include this.

Example:
> 2N-40 I'll be out on traffic at 9883 El Rancho Boulevard with a red BMW SUV San Andreas 12ABC34 occupied times 1

You should also generate a call in the F4 CAD or [cad.kcdojrp.com](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/officer).
Click `Create Call`, put TSTOP for the name and type the postal and click `Create`
You do not need to fill in the rest of the information yet if you don't want to.
Some LEO's choose to put the plate and/or description in the details now.

Mark yourself as 10-97(On scene)

Make contact with the individual at the vehicle.
> My name is [officer/deputy/rank] [last name] with the [department]

Mosty officers will say `Do you know why I pulled you over today` next.
But you can say many things like `Any reason for the speed today` or `I clocked you going 55 in a 25 back there`
This is up to the officer and their discretion.

You should ask for 3 things from the driver of the vehicle.
1. Drivers License/Proof of ID
2. Vehicle Registration
3. Insaurance Information/Proof of Insaurance.

The civillian should do `/me [civ name]` to provide you their name.

You will then let them know you will run their information and to stay in the vehicle.

Head back to your vehicle and here is where we will start running all of the information.
In the [CAD](https://cad.kcdojrp.com/officer) do a name search for the name provided and a vehicle search for the vehicle.
Make sure to check things like Valid Drivers License, Flags, Warrants, Insaurance status, etc.

I also suggest putting in the event logs of the call your drivers name and plate.
Ex. `31: JOHN DOE, 28: 12ABC24`
10-31 beaing ID/Check ID and 10-28 being resgistation/check resgitration.

After confirming their 3 documents are all valid with no issues, it's up to the officer on how to proceed, You may issue a verbal or written warning, ticket, or even an arrest.

Based on what you do may change how you proceed. Verbal warnings are not logged in the CAD.
When issuing a written warning/ticket/arrest make sure to include the vehicle and attach the call via the ID in the `Connections` tab.

Once completed, If the driver is let go, Give them the documents back and advise them of your decision. Inform them that they are free to go once you turn your emergency lights off.

Head back to your vehicle, Turn your lights off and finish off your report.
In the call we generated, Select the department, call type(TSTOP) and Fill in the details box with the initial stop timeline.
Ex;
> I clocked a speeding red SUV at 55mph in a 25mph zone on El Rancho Boulevard and initiated a traffic stop at 9883.

In the events you'll include your conclusion, Such as ticket or verbal warning and any other findings.

End the call and go back 10-8.

On the radio you'll announce your callsign, status, and disposition code(aka david code).
> [callsign] [disposition code][race] [reason] [status]

Ex.
> 2N-40 D4W Speed 10-8

2N-40 being your callsign, D4W is the disposition code, D4 being warned and W mean White(race), 10-8 meaning you are clear and available.

### W Dispatch
(with an active dispatcher)

LEO:
> 651(Six Five One) 2N-40 Traffic

You are letting dispatch know you are out on a traffic stop and ready to give them the information. However to avoid overwhelming the dispatch on the radio or if they are on a 911 call we don't provide the information till dispatch is ready.

Dispatch:
> 2N-40 Go ahead

Dispatch may also ask you to standby(wait) if they are dealing with another call.

LEO:
> 2N-40 I'll be out on traffic at [postal] [street/location] with a [color] [make/model/type] [plate type] [plate] occupied times [count]

Dispatch:
> Copy 2N-40 out at [postal] standby for return.

Dispatch acknolwedges the location, If dispatch says the wrong postal, Let them know.
Standby for return means they are searching the plate(if one was given).

Dispatch should be generating a CFS(Call for service) for you and assign you to it.

Make contact with the individual at the vehicle.
> My name is [officer/deputy/rank] [last name] with the [department]

Mosty officers will say `Do you know why I pulled you over today` next.
But you can say many things like `Any reason for the speed today` or `I clocked you going 55 in a 25 back there`
This is up to the officer and their discretion.

You should ask for 3 things from the driver of the vehicle.
1. Drivers License/Proof of ID
2. Vehicle Registration
3. Insaurance Information/Proof of Insaurance.

The civillian should do `/me [civ name]` to provide you their name.

You will then let them know you will run their information and to stay in the vehicle.

By this time dispatch will have your return for the plate, and you can radio in the driver name.
LEO:
> 651 2N-40 10-31 when ready.

This lets dispatch that you have a name/ID needing to be ran.
Dispatch:
> 2N-40 go ahead with your 31.

LEO:
> First is going to be [FIRST NAME], Last will be [LAST NAME], Common spelling.

Dispatch may ask to confirm a DOB if multiple people have that same name.
If the name is a none standard name, Spell the name using the [Phonetic Alphabet](https://docs.kcdojrp.com/docs/leo/information/codes#phonetic-alphabet)

Dispatch:
> 2N-40 standby.

Dispatch:
> 2N-40 your 28 returns [vehicle registration status] and you 31 returns [civ status].

10-28 meaning vehicle registration, 10-31 meaning ID.
Ex;
> 2N-40 your 28 returns to a valid red Dodge Charger registered to John Doe and you 31 returns valid, negative 29s.

10-29 meaning warrants.

LEO:
> 2N-40 Copy, I'll be back out with the driver.

Based on what you do may change how you proceed. Verbal warnings are not logged in the CAD.
When issuing a written warning/ticket/arrest make sure to include the vehicle and attach the call via the ID in the `Connections` tab.

Once completed, If the driver is let go, Give them the documents back and advise them of your decision. Inform them that they are free to go once you turn your emergency lights off.

Head back to your vehicle, Turn your lights off and finish off your report.
Fill in the details box with the initial stop timeline.
Ex;
> I clocked a speeding red SUV at 55mph in a 25mph zone on El Rancho Boulevard and initiated a traffic stop at 9883.

Once your narritvae has been added you'll announce over the radio you are clear.
LEO:
> 651 [callsign] [disposition code][race] [reason] [status]

Ex.
> 651 2N-40 D4W Speed 10-8

2N-40 being your callsign, D4W is the disposition code, D4 being warned and W mean White(race), 10-8 meaning you are clear and available.

Dispatch:
> Copy 2N-40 D4W Speed 10-8
