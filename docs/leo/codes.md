## Example Usage

Here you can find some examples of how to properly communicate with dispatch and other units.

Lets say your call sign is 1N-69 and you are just getting on shift.
You should radio dispatch(651) as follows:
- 651, 1N-69 10-8
- Six Five One, One Nora Six Nine ten eight  

Next lets say you pull over a vehicle with the plate 12ABC56
Radio out the following:
- 651, 1N-69 Traffic
- Six Five One, One Nora Six Nine Traffic
Dispatch will respond "1N-69 go ahead with your traffic"
- 651, 1N-69 I'll be out with San Andreas 12ABC56

Now lets say we need to run the drivers name
- 651, 1N-69 10-31 San Adreas Male when ready
- Six Five One, One Nora Six Nine Ten Thirty One, San Adreas Male when ready
Dispatch will respond "1N-69 go ahead with your 31"
- Here you will ready out the name, If it has common spelling, Say "Common Spelling" If not, Spell out the name using the [Phonetic Alphabet](/docs/leo/codes#phonetic-alphabet)

Once you are finished with the traffic stop you'll need to state the situation code, Commonly a [David Code](/docs/leo/codes#full-david-d-codes) and be clear and available.
Let assume you warned a while male for speeding.
- 651, 1N-69 D4W Speed, 10-8
- Six Five One, One Nora Six Nine, David four William, Speed, Ten eight
D4W = David, 4(Warned and Released), William = White Race
