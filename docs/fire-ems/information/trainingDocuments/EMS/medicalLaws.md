# Medical Laws

The following program will inform you of the more crucial laws relating to patient care and EMS. The guide will teach you all about them and hopefully answer any questions you may have in relation to laws.

## Do not Resuscitate (DNR)

Do not resuscitate is a medical order known by many as something similar to a No CPR order. This order tends to be confused with an order not to treat the patient though, which is not true. If you encounter a patient with a DNR order this means, in the event of cardiac arrest, you shall not initiate resuscitation. If in the event of something like severe trauma, a DNR order does not mean to not treat the patient, and you are clear to perform any action within your scope, except for CPR, to stabilize the patient.

If you are told, by a family member, friend or even the patient themselves that they have a DNR order, ask to see it. A valid DNR order will indicate that the patient wishes not to be resuscitated if in cardiac arrest and it will be signed by a physician. **If they can not present you with a valid DNR order then you must resuscitate.**

## Patient Refusal

All patients have the right to refuse medical treatment and or transport, but there are a few requirements they have to check out before they are able to do so.
- The patient must have sufficient information about his or her medical condition or injury;
- The patient must understand the risks and benefits of available options, including the option not to act;
- The patient must have the ability to use the above information to make a decision in keeping with his or her personal values;
- The patient must be able to communicate his or her choices;
- The patient must have the freedom of will to act without undue influence from other parties, including family and friends;
- The patient must not be under the influence of any substances such as drugs or alcohol;
- The patient must not have suffered any head trauma.

## The patient's right to privacy (HIPAA)

The HIPAA privacy rule is one known commonly by all medical professionals and even a lot of patients as their right to privacy and protection of information such as medical records and other identifiable medical information such as a scar in a specific location or past medical history.
In the field you are not to discuss a patientâ€™s condition to any bystanders unless given explicit permission from the patient, or you have been able to confirm their identity as a family member or close relative. 

If a patient is under police care, and you are transporting them to the hospital, you can inform them of the transport but you should not give any further information. If the police officer requests for further information ask for them to consult the receiving hospital.

**Do not go out of your way to identify someone, if you have the slightest doubts ask them to wait at the hospital for information from them.**
