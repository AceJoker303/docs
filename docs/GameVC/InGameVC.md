# ðŸŽ¤ Setting Up In-Game Voice Chat

Welcome to the guide to setting up your in-game voice chat. It is highly recommended you ensure this is setup prior to beginning your roleplay to ensure you can interact with other players.

## Initial Setup

Unless you have changed the settings in the past, it will be defaulted to off. Follow the steps below to setup the voice chat for the first time.

1. **Enter Your Settings:** Go into the pause menu, and navigate to the settings tab. Locate the Voice Chat section.
2. **Enable and Set Defaults:** Check to ensure that the voice chat is enable for listening and talking. Set your input device to the microphone you normally use, and set the output device to the speaker you normally use.
3. **Adjust Volumes:** It is recommended that you max out the `Voice Chat Volume`, reduce the `SFX Volume during Voice Chat` setting to close to half, and adjust the `Music Volume during Voice Chat` to your preferred level. Under the Talking section it is recommended you change your `Voice Chat Mode` to Push To Talk, adjust the `Microphone Volume` to max. If you are going to set `Voice Chat Mode` to Voice Activated then you will need to adjust the `Microphone Sensitivity` to your preferred level.
4. **Set Your Keybinds:** Navigate to the Key Bindings settings, then GTA Online, then locate the `Push to Talk` action. You may adjust this binding to any binding that works best for you.

# ðŸŽ® Using In-Game

## Voice Range

In the bottom right corner of the screen you will see `Normal [Range]`, this shows what range your voice chat is set to. `Whisper` is short range, quiet, meant for more discreet conversations. `Normal` is a talking voice, where others can hear you at a reasonable distance. `Shouting` is loud, meant for others to hear over long distances and over noisy environments.

## How to Use

Voice chat is used when you're speaking in character, to roleplay scenarios. We do not use it to define what our characters are doing, those are done through the `/me` command. Voice chat is defaulted to `N`, but will be set to whatever keybind you set. By pressing this key you will activate the voice chat.
