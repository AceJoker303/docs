:::info Advanced Definition

Here is a bit more in-depth explanation of what this plugin does:

The SirenSetting Limit Adjuster 2.0.2 is an ASI that modifies the GTAV siren buffer limit. Instead of the default 21 lights per vehicle, it allows up to 32 lights. Additionally, it increases the number of light object ID's allowed by FiveM natively from 255 to a whopping 65535. This expansion enables more custom lights for all vehicles, providing a richer visual experience.
